# Re-add common and Taskmaster-specific ignores that were in your original file

# Ensure that if a directory is whitelisted, its contents are also considered.
# For .cursor/, we only want mcp.json, so we'll add:
!.cursor/
!.cursor/mcp.json
# and make sure other things in .cursor (like .cursor/rules/) are ignored if not explicitly whitelisted.
